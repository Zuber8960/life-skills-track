# Question 1 : What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

***

Sexual harassment encompasses various forms of unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. It can be categorized into three primary types: verbal, visual, and physical. Here are some specific behaviors that can contribute to sexual harassment:

- **Verbal Harassment** : This includes making comments about a person's clothing or body, sharing sexual or gender-based jokes or remarks, requesting sexual favors, repeatedly asking someone out, using sexual innuendos, spreading rumors about someone's personal or sexual life, or using foul and obscene language.

- **Visual Harassment** : Visual harassment involves displaying or sharing sexually suggestive or explicit content through posters, drawings, pictures, screen savers, cartoons, emails, or text messages.

- **Physical Harassment** : Physical harassment consists of unwelcome physical contact or actions of a sexual nature. It can involve sexual assault, impeding or blocking someone's movement, inappropriate touching such as kissing, hugging, patting, stroking, or rubbing, sexual gesturing, leering, or staring.

# Question 2 : What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

***


If you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of sexual harassment, it is important to take appropriate action to address the situation. Here's what you can do:


- **Document the incidents** : Keep a detailed record of the incidents, including dates, times, locations and a description of what happened. This documentation will provide evidence if you decide to report the harassment later.

- **Report the incidents** : If you feel comfortable and safe doing so, report the incidents to your immediate supervisor, human resources department, or another designated authority within your organization. Follow the established reporting procedures and provide them with the documented evidence.


- **Review company policies** : Familiarize yourself with your organization's policies and procedures regarding sexual harassment. Understand the reporting process and any available support mechanisms.


- **Seek support** : Reach out to trusted colleagues, friends, or family members to discuss your experiences and seek emotional support. Additionally, consider seeking professional support from counselors or support hotlines specializing in workplace harassment.


- **Cooperate with investigations** : If an investigation takes place, cooperate fully and provide any necessary information or testimony. Ensure that your perspective is heard and taken into account during the process.


- **Know your rights** : Familiarize yourself with the legal protections against sexual harassment in your jurisdiction. Consult labor laws, anti-discrimination laws, or employment regulations to understand your rights and potential avenues for recourse.



It is crucial to prioritize your safety and well-being. If you feel that reporting internally is not effective or if the harassment continues, you may want to consult with legal professionals who specialize in employment law to explore additional options or consider filing a complaint with the appropriate external agencies.
