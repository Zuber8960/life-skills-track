## 3. Understanding Internal Locus of Control

How to stay motivated Video - The Locus Rule - 5:47 minutes - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZhoeSaPF-k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZhoeSaPF-k)

#### Question 5
What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?

#### Answer 5
The internal locus of control refers to the belief that individuals have control over their own lives and the outcomes they experience. It suggests that people attribute their successes or failures to their own abilities, efforts, and decisions rather than external factors beyond their control. Individuals with an internal locus of control believe that they can influence their circumstances and shape their own destinies.

The key point in the video is that having an internal locus of control is crucial for maintaining motivation. The study conducted at Columbia University demonstrated that when students were told they did well because they worked hard, they exhibited higher levels of motivation. They spent more time on challenging puzzles and overall showed a greater willingness to solve problems. On the other hand, when students were told they did well because they were smart and gifted, they displayed lower motivation levels. They focused on easier tasks, spent less time on difficult puzzles, and reported less enjoyment of the experience.

The video emphasizes that the locus of control is a significant factor in motivation. Following are the differences between the different locus of controls:

| Internal Locus of Control | External Locus of Control |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Belief in personal control over life and outcomes | Attribution of success or failure to external factors |
| Attributes achievements to own abilities, efforts, and decisions | Attributes achievements to factors beyond personal control |
| Associated with higher levels of motivation | Associated with lower levels of motivation |
| Willingness to take on challenges and solve problems | Preference for easier tasks and avoidance of challenges |
| Enjoyment of the experience | Less enjoyment of the experience |
| Recognizes personal agency and responsibility | Perceives lack of control and external influence |
